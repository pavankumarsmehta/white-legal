Requirements:
--------------

Hello

My name is Alex White, I run a firm called "White Legals" in which I need to manage my employees. Just basic things like name, email, phone number would be enough for now. Also I need to have access across everything where I can manage these users. I can make an user inactive if needed.

Coming to the business I do have to manage my clients on a regular basis, basic details such as their name, email, address, city, notes will be fine for now. The employees would be doing this on a regular basis.

So let's go ahead with these requirements for now.


Technology Stack:
-----------------
Xampp Server + PHP + MySQL + Laravel + Bootstrap


Once done:
----------
Version the code on GitHub and share the repo URL.
